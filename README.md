# Giphy_API

### Overview
  This website uses the Giphy API to put gifs onto the page. Users will click a button for their favorite rock band and ten static gifs will load onto the page. Then the user can click individually on the gifs to make them run, clicking again to stop the gif.
  Also, the user can search for their favorite rock band. When the user does this, a new button is created for the new rock band and then it can be clicked on to populate the page with ten new gifs.
  The user can create as many new buttons for their favorite bands as they want.
